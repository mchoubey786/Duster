    <h3><strong>First Generation (2010)</strong></h3>
    <h3><em>Design</em></h3>
    <p>
      <h4>
        The Duster was initially introduced in the ice racing version prepared for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andros_Trophy">Andros Trophy</a>, presented for the first time on 17 November 2009. The production version was revealed to the media on 8 December 2009, and was subsequently launched at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show#2010">Geneva Motor Show</a> in March 2010.

        Based on the B0 platform, the Duster measures 4.31 metres (169.7 in) in length, 1.82 metres (71.7 in) in width and has 210 mm (8.3 in) of ground clearance. Its luggage space has a volume of up to 475 litres (16.8 cu ft), while with the rear benchseat folded and tipped forward, its carrying ability can exceed 1,600 litres (57 cu ft).

        The first-generation Duster was offered with two-wheel drive or four-wheel-drive. The 4x4 variants make use of Nissan's all-wheel drive system, which allows the driver to choose from three different driving modes: Auto, in which the rear-wheel drive is engaged automatically in case the front wheels lose grip, Lock, whereby 50 per cent of torque is consistently fed through the rear axle, and 2WD where the transmission is locked into front-wheel drive for maximum fuel efficiency.

        The Renault 4 had some influence on the Duster's design.

    <h4><em><p>
      As I sat behind the wheel of the Duster, I couldn't help but be struck by its power and versatility. With just a turn of the wheel, 
      this vehicle effortlessly navigates the most challenging urban roads, thanks in part to its enormous, fat donut tires and uncomplicated suspension.
      Despite some shortcomings in cabin quality and ergonomics, the simplicity of the Duster allows the driver to focus on the task at hand, rather than being 
      distracted by unnecessary distractions. Yes, it may be a bit slow and lacking in active safety features, but when compared to competitors that charge twice 
      as much, the Duster more than holds its own.
      This is a vehicle that doesn't try to deceive or make you feel like you are settling for less. Instead, it delivers a driving experience that is truly worth 
      twice its price. It's no wonder we have such a deep appreciation for the Duster - it is a car that consistently outperforms expectations and delivers a driving 
      experience that is truly unparalleled in its class.
